    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
     <p>My idea is having some sort of technology to be able to block certain people out in your life, literally. Just how you would be able to block people on social media when they have been harassing you or their content offends you. This is inspired by one of the Black Mirror episodes, “White Christmas”.<br>In a wider scale, this technology would be able to block criminals living in society, such as registered sex-offenders. They would be blocked by everyone in society and the people of society would know they’re a criminal.</p>
